You might wonder why I chose to create an open source clone of Kirby.

Well, firstly, I think it is a great system. Playing around with it just a little, I could see the potential.

However, I could also see the limitations.

So, I decided that I would kill two birds with one stone. I would create an Open Source clone of Kirby and fix a bunch of other problems into the bargain.
