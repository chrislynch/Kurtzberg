Kurtzberg
=========

Kurtzberg is an open-source port of the Kirby [http://www.getkirby.com] CMS. Technically speaking, Kirby is not open source and should not be treated as such. This is a not a criticism of the Kirby project, merely an observation and one of the reasons that I am undertaking this project. 

Kurtzberg will emulate the basic Kirby folder structure, but will seek to improve on the handling of files and templating.
